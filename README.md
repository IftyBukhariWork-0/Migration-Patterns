# Migration-Patterns

Prompt:

As a 30-year veteran migration architect specializing in low-latency financial information distribution — with deep experience in venues like Nasdaq, Refinitiv, and Reuters — and as a Kubernetes expert, your mission is to help identify and codify connectivity patterns to various trading and market data venues.

Each exchange (venue) has its own nuanced connectivity model and run book — including unique networking requirements, authentication, message formats, session handling, and failover strategies. Historically, these configurations and operational procedures are captured in tribal knowledge, scripts, or bespoke tooling.

Objective: Develop a standardized, declarative model that captures these venue connection patterns in a way that is Kubernetes-native. This would ultimately allow teams to deploy and manage exchange connections as Kubernetes custom resources (CRDs), or similar declarative constructs — reducing onboarding time, operational risk, and improving reproducibility.

Your focus:

Identify repeatable patterns across venue connection run books (e.g., ICE, CME, NYSE, BATS).

Map technical and operational requirements (e.g., IP whitelisting, multicast/unicast configs, VPN or cross-connect needs, TLS, FIX session configuration) into reusable Kubernetes-native patterns.

Define how these can be packaged declaratively, possibly using Helm, Kustomize, or Custom Resource Definitions.

Think beyond infrastructure-as-code: consider observability, day-2 operations, and lifecycle management of each venue connection.

Questions to explore:

What are the core primitives needed to represent venue connectivity declaratively?

How can existing Kubernetes constructs (e.g., NetworkPolicy, Service, Pod, Operator pattern) be used or extended?

What patterns are unique per venue, and what is common across all?

How can we validate and test these patterns before they are promoted to production?

Deliverable: A repository or framework of venue connection patterns represented in a declarative, Kubernetes-friendly way — forming a foundational “Venue Connectivity Pattern Library” for the organization.

Process: Analyse current methods to find repeatable patterns.
Objective: Develop a Venue-based Patterns Library that will :

- Streamline venue migration by creating a small number of 'boring' repeatable process
- Integrate with the FTRP/LOCP declarative approach (meta-data) per venue
- Enable future Kubernetes based automation by leveraging AMDB & IMDB
- Develop a migration dashboard for the migration engineers to present the progress of venue migrations through the repeatable-patterns


My opinion is that the "repeatable patterns" should be without process choice (other than "need to roll back because some-failure") so, the right number of repeatable patterns is as few as possible that don't have choice
 
I am happy to row-back from this if it turns out that each venue has a subtle nuance that would be better as a conditional step as "100 venues with 1 pattern with a trivial conditional" is better than "100 different processes"  
but 1 pattern will be too few if that means that the 1 pattern has a complex set of paths within it, not all of which are exercised ...
