# Migration-Patterns

Prompt:

As a 30-year veteran migration architect specializing in low-latency financial information distribution — with deep experience in venues like Nasdaq, Refinitiv, and Reuters — and as a Kubernetes expert, your mission is to help identify and codify connectivity patterns to various trading and market data venues.

Each exchange (venue) has its own nuanced connectivity model and run book — including unique networking requirements, authentication, message formats, session handling, and failover strategies. Historically, these configurations and operational procedures are captured in tribal knowledge, scripts, or bespoke tooling.

Objective: Develop a standardized, declarative model that captures these venue connection patterns in a way that is Kubernetes-native. This would ultimately allow teams to deploy and manage exchange connections as Kubernetes custom resources (CRDs), or similar declarative constructs — reducing onboarding time, operational risk, and improving reproducibility.

Your focus:

Identify repeatable patterns across venue connection run books (e.g., ICE, CME, NYSE, BATS).

Map technical and operational requirements (e.g., IP whitelisting, multicast/unicast configs, VPN or cross-connect needs, TLS, FIX session configuration) into reusable Kubernetes-native patterns.

Define how these can be packaged declaratively, possibly using Helm, Kustomize, or Custom Resource Definitions.

Think beyond infrastructure-as-code: consider observability, day-2 operations, and lifecycle management of each venue connection.

Questions to explore:

What are the core primitives needed to represent venue connectivity declaratively?

How can existing Kubernetes constructs (e.g., NetworkPolicy, Service, Pod, Operator pattern) be used or extended?

What patterns are unique per venue, and what is common across all?

How can we validate and test these patterns before they are promoted to production?

Deliverable: A repository or framework of venue connection patterns represented in a declarative, Kubernetes-friendly way — forming a foundational “Venue Connectivity Pattern Library” for the organization.

Process: Analyse current methods to find repeatable patterns.
Objective: Develop a Venue-based Patterns Library that will :

- Streamline venue migration by creating a small number of 'boring' repeatable process
- Integrate with the FTRP/LOCP declarative approach (meta-data) per venue
- Enable future Kubernetes based automation by leveraging AMDB & IMDB
- Develop a migration dashboard for the migration engineers to present the progress of venue migrations through the repeatable-patterns


My opinion is that the "repeatable patterns" should be without process choice (other than "need to roll back because some-failure") so, the right number of repeatable patterns is as few as possible that don't have choice
 
I am happy to row-back from this if it turns out that each venue has a subtle nuance that would be better as a conditional step as "100 venues with 1 pattern with a trivial conditional" is better than "100 different processes"  
but 1 pattern will be too few if that means that the 1 pattern has a complex set of paths within it, not all of which are exercised ...

DISCUSSION:

The goal is to analyse existing venue connections to identify commonalities and ultimately:
Develop a standardised taxonomy and data model
Define a small set of reusable, declarative migration templates (“patterns”)
Integrate these patterns into metadata-driven automation frameworks (FTRP/LOCP, AMDB, IMDB)
 
Ideally, the aim is for a concise set of patterns rather than a large variety.
 
I believe the necessary information exists across various teams (networks, development, operations), and John has already suggested a few key contacts:
 
Andrew Krisby (Framework Lead)
Zhe Wang (APAC Venue Team Lead)
James Telford (EMEA Venue Team Lead)
Eric Compton (AMER Venue Team Lead)


That list seems like a good start as there are really only a few patterns which can be composed of layers -- network protocol, connection security requirements, exchange login requirements and similar.  Each of those has a defined pattern, so we should be able to compose a large variety of connectivity details by selecting an item from each list, as it were.

We can focus on the 80/20 model.  As such, we have TCP and UDP connectivity as the primary means.  There are others, like rrcp, SQL replication, etc., but those are such that there are only 1 or 2 venues using each.  Therefore, we probably shouldn't try to model them, for now, aside from ensuring that we have a defined network protocol type entry in the DB.
 
Some venues will have multiple UDP and TCP connections -- UDP channels for data, UDP channels for recovery, TCP to request recovery, UDP for reference, etc.  So, while there are multiple such connections required, the network protocols are well defined.
 
Therefore, we should probably restrict our patterns to network protocol as a pattern.  Then, a given venue can use multiple such patterns for connectivity.  That keeps it simple and reduces the number of patterns we have to consider.
 
Then, for credentialling (logins), we have actual user/password, certificates, machine auth, and such.
 
For security, there is TLS, custom encryption, certificates, SSL, etc.
 
So, network protocols need to be: TCP, UDP, http, https, ftp, and sftp as primary connection types.
 
I think web sockets is https.
 
web socket can also use http.
 
rrcp is a direct layer on Ethernet frames, so a peer, if you will, of tcp and udp.
 


I think that will help us identify patterns to use for network connectivity.
 
I'm still unable to find details about SQL replication network protocols.  I'm guessing it is TCP under the covers and SQL replication is simply layered on top of TCP using custom ports and custom users on both publisher and subscriber sides of the connection.
 
If we try to combine all of those details into patterns, we'll end up with 600 patterns for 600 venues.  By breaking it down like the above, we will have probably less than 10 patterns in each of network, credentials/logins, and security, which we can use to pick and choose for given venue.  I think that simplifies this considerably.
 
If we have a list, say from EMEA, of venue connectivity details, we can look to break it down this way.  Perhaps we also find another detail, say that for security, we may need to allow selection of multiple options, not just one of them -- TLS and certificates, or TLS and ACLs.
 
There should not be connectivity from EMEA to AMERS, for example, at least not for real time flows into the LOCP platform.
 
For cloud, perhaps as we may site a venue ingest point in EMEA, but the publisher may be in APAC.
 
Those are not in view for LOCP, however.
